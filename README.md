Tic Tac Toe using JS and Factory Functions

Nov 12, 2025

Create basic HTML, CSS and JS files
Check link and script src for functionality
Add Basic functions in to JS to create players, draw game board, add player marker to board, switch 
player turns, check for winning conditions and play through a basic game in the console
Add function to check for tie game and add round counter to play function so the game stops at a full board
Add function to check if cell is full already before player selects it, if it sees that it is full then
it prompts the same player to pick a different cell

Still need to re-work functions into factories to share variables and to encapsulate the whole game in a module
